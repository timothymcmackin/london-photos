The first thing I did in London is find somewhere comfy to sit until I could get into the apartment. This pub was surprisingly quiet in the busy SoHo neighborhood.

After I got into the apartment I went out to a very different bar to watch the football game, part of the 2024 European championships. I got to see England score, so it wasn't too boring. The crowd was super focused and I don't think anyone bought a drink or went out to smoke while the game was on, not that we could move in there anyway.

Here's the apartment they set me up in. Very comfy. The killer feature was an all-in-one washer/dryer so I could take less clothes and do laundry halfway through the trip.

This is the view from the flat, of a big churchyard.

On Sunday I bummed around town and saw a street art show where these giant animated characters seemed to step over us.

Here's the reception desk at the office. Straightforward, pleasant office on 4 narrow floors. There's no sign on the door or anything, maybe because of historical building rules?

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/LocopopsTreats.jpg)

I brought snacks from Locopops to share and they didn't last long.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TTPatio.jpg)

Here's the 4th-floor patio at the office.

For the next big soccer game we ordered pizza and watched. England tied 1-1 which was apparently good enough.

This is the view of SoHo square from the second floor office where I worked for the week. It got pretty crowded in the late afternoons with people picnicing there.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/SohoSquare.jpg)

SoHo square has ping-pong tables in heavy use and was usually full of people.

Another view of SoHo square.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Pickles1.jpg)

Dog-friendly office! There was at least one dog there every day. I got to meet Pickles the pug, whose tongue is always hanging out. I see her in my weekly department meetings.

Here I am outside the Globe for the Taming of the Shrew. I still remember the last play I saw here well. It's a great experience, traditional and accessible at the same time.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/InsideGlobe1.jpg)

Here's the inside of the Globe. I love being a real Groundling, watching the show resting my arms on the stage.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TheatreLies.jpg)

LIES, Globe, LIES. Not that I really wanted to see nudity during The Taming of the Shrew — it probably would not have been the good kind.

Some selfies from the Thames.

A photo from around Picadilly.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Jazzbourne2.jpg)

Had a great time dancing at Jazzbourne, a club run by a dancer and  dance teacher. I had a fun group lesson and then stayed all night. Tiny place, looks like a labor of love keeping it afloat.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Jazzbourne7.jpg)

Very friendly people, fun place.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Jazzbourne4.jpg)

This is the back of the house at Jazzbourne.

This is on the bus to Jazzbourne (second floor, of course) with Parliament in the background.

Here's the outside of Rules before my big dinner.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/RulesPlaque.jpg)

The plaque outside Rules. "RULES SERVES THE TRADITIONAL FOOD OF THIS COUNTRY AT ITS BEST - IT SPECIALISES IN CLASSIC GAME COOKERY AND IS FORTUNATE IN OWNING AN ESTATE IN THE HIGH PENNINES
"ENGLAND'S LAST WILDERNESS" WHICH SUPPLIES GAME FOR THE RESTAURANT AND WHERE IT IS ABLE TO EXERCISE ITS OWN QUALITY CONTROLS AND DETERMINE HOW THE GAME IS TREATED."

Some photos from inside Rules, where I sat at M's table from the James Bond movies. Didn't seem kosher to take pictures of the food.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/ShakshukaBreakfast.jpg)

Had a great breakfast of shakshuka with beans at this cafe in SoHo.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/ToiAndMoi.jpg)

Had a spectacular hot chocolate here!

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/InsideWrong.jpg)

This is at The Play That Goes Wrong, which was a riot and involved tons of great moments of comic timing.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/RooftopBar1.jpg)

Some co-workers came with me to Goes Wrong and we went out afterwards.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/RooftopBar3.jpg)

This is the view from the rooftop bar we went to. Covent Garden closed down early-ish but SoHo stayed open till late every night.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/BlackPenny1.jpg)

Had a nice dinner at The Black Penny and a great bramble, which is a classic London cocktail with gin and blackberries.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/ClimateProtestParade.jpg)

Big climate protest around Hyde Park, with people dressed as all kinds of animals. The whole rest of the day I kept seeing people in costume around town.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TrainStation.jpg)

Here I am at the train station. It's amazing that you can get a train from London to Paris in 2.5 hours. The round trip cost $420, which is apparently too expensive for the Londoners — it's often cheaper to fly. I guess you can add more capacity for airlines faster than you can for trains. Still, it was super easy and comfortable.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/LeDeuxMagots1.jpg)

I was hungry when I got to Paris and didn't quite know what to do, so I went to a café that's mentioned constantly in The Amelia Project, a favorite audio drama of mine. The characters in the show are based in London, but they always either serve their clients hot cocoa from Le Deux Magots (The Two Magi) or apologize and grieve that they don't have any to serve.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/LeDeuxMagots2.jpg)

I figured it was as good a place as any to have lunch (if expensive), and I had a nice croque moinseur and of course the cocoa, which was very old-style thick and velvety and very, very, very sweet.

I spent most of my free time in Paris just walking along the Seine, sitting, and stopping at cafés.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/SeineCafes.jpg)

Here's what these cafés look like from above. Some are on the banks and some are on boats.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/SeineDance5.jpg)

I also discovered three groups of dancers on the river. There was tango, a Latin dance that I didn't recognize, and swing. Of course I joined right in. A Latvian dance partner said that they did this by the river every weekend.

More photos of dancing.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/SeineGraffiti.jpg)

I liked this graffiti along the river.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/ParisHotel.jpg)

This is the hotel. It was small but really well kept. The room was more or less what you'd get in NYC.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/NomadicOffice.jpg)

This is where the office of our sister company is. They are packing up this week and moving across town soon.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/LeNorvegien.jpg)

The people there took me to a fabulous lunch place where I had "Le Norvegien," which was a lot like a croque but with salmon and avocado. I had a stellar chocolate mousse with zaatar and olive oil. Definitely going to try some zaatar on chocolate at home; I don't really like heat in my chocolate but the savory of the zaatar was great.
